  <h2><li><a href="https./www.paranoia.com">Paranoia.com</a></li></h2>
  <h3>idk much about this website but all i know is it was a very sketchy website used to post websites with no limits
    so you could literally make a website to sell dr*gs with the police having no way to find out who you are.
    Now its taken down and owned by disney. hSo you should either get sent to an error or the disney home page.
