      <h2>All about me:</h2> 
         <h3>I was born in 09/09/2011 in Turkey, Bursa, Osmangazi hospital.
         I later moved to Norway when i was 5, I personally didnt even know what was going on. i thought
          we were going to a vacation but nah, we moved here. I didnt notice till 3 months when i asked my mom this "Hey mom?
         When are we going back?" Her answer was "What? We live here now" and i cried my eyeballs out.
          then a couple months later, i got the urge to speak fluent norwegian.  My norwegian was perfect, people didnt understand i was turkish at first. 
         I first lived in Oslo, then Steinsjer and then trondheim. Thats were i live right now! I suddenly got this 
         urge to immideatly know english and i started talking at the second i got that urge. I was speaking
         better english than my brother who studied english for straight 2 years. I didnt even know what 
         Present Perfectum was but i was still using it. Then that one day came, an english test.
          I was lke "oh no! this is going to be so hard!" but when i realized what present perfectum was, i was like "Wait my teachers are struggling with this? Lemme be the teacher 
         instead!" I was the only one who scored a 100 and i was 11 at the time soo it wasnt too hard.
          And then, i got another urge, learn graffiti, do something with your life. thats exactly what i heard
         in my head. </h3>

         <h3>Then i got yet another urge, Learn the name of every single tag in your city: Nerv√∏s, Time,
         Sleep, NTS, LMK, Grunnvann, CodFish, HTP, HP, Atus, Bozo, SW, SK and Hosek.
         </h3>
         <h3>then i got yet ANOTHER urge... Learn coding... 
             And here i am! Making this effortless website.
         if anybody is going to look at, i wouldnt give the two fattest f*cks
         </h3>
